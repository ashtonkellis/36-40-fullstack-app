## Submission Instructions
  * **This is a rolling lab that that will last through Friday. All subsequent assignments this week require that you have a *mid-term project* or a *substantially finished Lab 18* that implement account and profile creation with basic auth and bearer auth. If, for some reason, those projects are not suitable for these current lab assignments, you may use [Lecture 18](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401d25/tree/master/back-end/18-asset-management) as your backup. *However*, you can only get a maximum of 9 points if you do this.**
  * Submit a link to your pull request:
  * Submit a question: what are you thoughts on the use of a switch statement in the render method in landing.js? pro or noob?
