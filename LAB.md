## Configuration  
#### backend
* Make a new route called `/api/profiles/me` that returns a profile matching the provided `accountId`. Reference [lecture code](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401d25/blob/master/back-end/18-asset-management/aws-s3-asset-mgt/src/router/profile-router.js) for how these routes should be formatted.
 
## Testing 
 * No extra testing required today, though **it is strongly recommended to complete the testing for [Lab 36](https://github.com/seattle-javascript-401d25/36-40-fullstack-app#testing-dont-worry-about-this-today)**

##  Documentation  
Write a description of the project in your README.md

## Submission Instructions
  * **This is a rolling lab that that will last through Friday. All subsequent assignments this week require that you have a *mid-term project* or a *substantially finished Lab 18* that implement account and profile creation with basic auth and bearer auth. If, for some reason, those projects are not suitable for these current lab assignments, you may use [Lecture 18](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401d25/tree/master/back-end/18-asset-management) as your backup. *However*, you can only get a maximum of 9 points if you do this.**
  * Work in a fork of this repository
  * Work in a branch on your fork
  * Submit a pull request to your forked repository
  * Submit a link to your pull request on canvas
  * Submit a question, observation, and how long you spent on canvas  
  * Submit the Github URL to the backend repo you selected
  * Submit any necessary `.env` variables for BOTH your backend and front end projects so that TA's can have an easier time configuring their environments
